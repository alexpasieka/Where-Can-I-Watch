# Where Can I Watch?

This is a reactive web app that displays where movies and TV shows are available to be streamed utilizing a movie database and streaming availability API.
Vue.js was used as the reactive framework and Bootstrap was used for visual design help.

* While the movie database used (OMDb API) is very up to date, the streaming availability API (Utelly API) is not, so this is not necessarily practical.
